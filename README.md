SkillCraft Technology: Tic-Tac-Toe Web Application üéÆ
This is an interactive and responsive Tic-Tac-Toe game developed as part of the SkillCraft Technology Internship. The project demonstrates core front-end development skills, including HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create a classic two-player game with a modern and clean user interface.

‚ú® Features
Two-Player Gameplay: The game allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid.

Winning & Draw Detection: The application automatically detects a winning condition (three in a row) or a draw, and displays the result. The winning cells are highlighted to show the victorious combination.

Interactive UI: The game board is built with a responsive grid layout. The cells change color on hover and indicate which player's turn it is.

Restart Functionality: A "Restart Game" button allows players to reset the board and start a new game at any time.

Responsive Design: The game is fully responsive and provides an optimal experience on both desktop and mobile devices.

Modern & Clean Aesthetic: The design features a dark color scheme with vibrant accents for a sleek, modern look.

üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used
HTML5: For the semantic structure of the game board and controls.

CSS3: For styling the game, including the grid layout, color scheme, and responsive design with media queries.

JavaScript: Powers the game logic, handling player turns, win/draw condition checks, and updating the game state and display.
